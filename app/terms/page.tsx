            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong>
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              You and Oath agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App (collectively, "Disputes") will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, except as specified below.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than court, uses different discovery rules, and has limited appeal rights. Arbitration is final and binding.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Either party may pursue a Dispute in small claims court if the Dispute qualifies for small claims court. Additionally, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in court to prevent infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights. You or Oath may also bring a Dispute to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies that may seek relief on your behalf.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Arbitration Procedures</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA's rules and fee information are available at www.adr.org. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or another mutually agreed location.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of written submissions, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing. For claims over $10,000, the arbitrator will decide the hearing format.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Arbitration Fees</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for claims of $10,000 or less, unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous. For claims over $10,000, the AAA rules will govern fee allocation.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Unless both you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>YOU AND OATH WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.</strong> You and Oath are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Opt-Out Right</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, email address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration agreement. Send opt-out notices to:
