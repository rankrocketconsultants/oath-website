            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">What We Don't Do</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We do not sell identifiable personal information (such as your name, email, or specific task content) to third parties.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">Aggregated and Anonymized Data</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We may aggregate and anonymize your usage data to create statistical insights that cannot identify you individually. This anonymized data may be used for:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>Product improvement and feature development</li>

              <li>Marketing and advertising our services</li>
              <li>Sharing with business partners, advertisers, or research institutions to better understand productivity trends</li>
            </ul>

              For example, we may share insights like "70% of users complete tasks scheduled in the morning" without revealing any individual user's data.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-heading-sm mb-3 text-oath-text">AI Model Training</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>What We Do:</strong> We use anonymized usage patterns to improve Oath's AI features. For example, we analyze patterns like "users typically schedule tasks 3 days in advance" or "morning tasks have higher completion rates" to make the Oath Keeper notification system smarter.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>What We DON'T Do:</strong> We do NOT use your specific task titles, descriptions, or personal content to train general-purpose AI models. We do NOT share your task content with OpenAI or any third party for AI model training. Your tasks remain private.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              <strong>Specifically:</strong> Anonymized metadata includes timing patterns, completion rates, notification response times, and feature usage statisticsâ€”never the actual content of your tasks or commitments.
